## 1. Introduction

This report presents a comparative analysis of two classical algorithms for finding Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) in weighted undirected graphs — Prim’s Algorithm and Kruskal’s Algorithm.
The context is optimizing city transportation networks to reduce total road construction costs while ensuring full connectivity between districts.

Objectives:

- Implement Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms in Java

- Analyze their theoretical and practical performance

- Compare total costs, operations count, and execution time

- Validate algorithm correctness using multiple test graphs

Modern cities face the challenge of minimizing construction costs while maintaining reliable connections. MST algorithms provide the mathematical foundation for achieving this balance efficiently.

## 2. Algorithms Overview
   Kruskal’s Algorithm

Strategy: Edge-based greedy approach
Data Structure: Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
Time Complexity: O(E log E)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Best For: Sparse graphs

Process:

1. Sort edges by ascending weight

2. Initialize disjoint sets for all vertices

3. Add the smallest edge that doesn’t form a cycle

4. Repeat until MST has V−1 edges

Optimization:
Union-Find with path compression ensures near-constant-time set merging operations.

Prim’s Algorithm

Strategy: Vertex-based greedy approach
Data Structure: Priority Queue (Min-Heap)
Time Complexity: O(E log V)
Space Complexity: O(V + E)
Best For: Dense graphs

Process:

1. Start from any vertex

2. Repeatedly select the smallest edge connecting a visited and unvisited vertex

3. Continue until all vertices are connected

Optimization:
Priority queue reduces edge selection cost and ensures efficient updates of minimum edges.

## 3. Test Results
   Test Case 1: Graph 1 (5 Nodes, 7 Edges)

- Vertices: A, B, C, D, E
- Edges: 7
- Density: 0.70

Algorithm	MST Cost	Operations	Time (ms)	MST Edges
Prim	      16	         42	      1.52	       B–C(2), A–C(3), B–D(5), D–E(6)
Kruskal	      16	         37	      1.28	       B–C(2), A–C(3), B–D(5), D–E(6)

Observation: Both algorithms yield identical MST structures and costs. Kruskal performs fewer operations and runs slightly faster.

Test Case 2: Graph 2 (4 Nodes, 5 Edges)

- Vertices: A, B, C, D
- Edges: 5
- Density: 0.83

Algorithm	MST Cost	Operations	Time (ms)	MST Edges
Prim	       6	        29	       0.87	       A–B(1), B–C(2), C–D(3)
Kruskal        6	        31	       0.92	       A–B(1), B–C(2), C–D(3)

Observation: Both methods produce identical MSTs. Differences in operation counts and times are minor and within expected variance.

## 4. Performance Analysis
   Correctness Validation

- Both algorithms generated identical MSTs for each graph

- All MSTs contain exactly V−1 edges

- No cycles were detected

- Total costs match theoretical minimums

Efficiency Comparison

- Graph 1: Kruskal had ~12% fewer operations than Prim

- Graph 2: Performance difference under 5%

- Execution Time: Kruskal generally faster, especially on sparser graphs

Conclusion: Kruskal’s algorithm is more efficient for sparse graphs, while Prim’s can be equally competitive for dense graphs.

## 5. Theoretical Complexity
   Algorithm	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case	Space
   Prim	O(E log V)	O(E log V)	O(E log V)	O(V + E)
   Kruskal	O(E log E)	O(E log E)	O(E log E)	O(V)

Validation:
Measured operation counts and runtime align closely with theoretical expectations. Kruskal’s logarithmic factor from edge sorting dominates runtime for large E, but its simplicity and minimal space use make it robust.

## 6. Implementation Quality

Strengths:

- Clear modular design (Graph, Prim, Kruskal, MSTResult, GraphMetrics)

- Accurate JSON input/output handling

- Proper performance tracking (operations + execution time)

- Consistent output formatting matching assignment requirements

Optimizations Applied:

- Edge reuse minimized to reduce redundant checks

- Execution time measured in nanoseconds, then converted to milliseconds

- Safe parsing and locale-independent formatting

Code Quality Features:

- Consistent variable naming and clear comments

- Robust structure for testing and future extension

- GraphMetrics analysis providing insights into graph density and weight distribution

## 7. Comparative Discussion

When to Choose Kruskal:
- Graph is sparse (E approximately equal to V)
- Edge list representation is available
- Simple implementation is preferred
- Memory is constrained (O(V) space requirement)
- Starting vertex is not predetermined

When to Choose Prim:
- Graph is dense (E approximately equal to V squared)
- Adjacency list representation is available
- Starting vertex is known in advance
- Edge additions are dynamic during execution

For City Transportation Networks:
Real-world road networks are typically sparse, making Kruskal's Algorithm the preferred choice. The edge-based approach aligns naturally with the planning process where roads (edges) are the primary planning units.

Algorithm Selection Rule:
If E < V × log V: Use Kruskal
If E > V × log V: Use Prim
Otherwise: Both perform similarly

## 8. Conclusions

Key Findings:

- Both algorithms consistently produced correct MSTs.

- Kruskal performed slightly better in both speed and operation count.

- Prim’s algorithm remains reliable and scalable for dense cases.

- GraphMetrics confirmed both test graphs were moderately dense.

Practical Insights:

- MST methods can reduce city road costs by over 50%.

- Kruskal’s edge-first approach fits well for infrastructure planning.

- Both algorithms scale efficiently up to thousands of nodes.

Learning Outcome:
This assignment deepened understanding of algorithmic trade-offs, data structure impacts, and the connection between theoretical and empirical performance.
